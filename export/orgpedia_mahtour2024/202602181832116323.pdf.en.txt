The Proposal:
The Mody and Persian scripts are of particular importance in understanding the historical, cultural, and administrative heritage of Maharashtra. The Modi script served as the language of government, while the Persian script was used for political documents, decrees, and foreign affairs. Today, though the use of these scripts has declined in modern times, they are our invaluable historical treasure and the need of the hour is to preserve and promote them. Ancient documents in both these scripts contain invaluable documents of the history of Maharashtra. Hence, the Director, Directorate of Archaeology, Mumbai has proposed to confer the Mody and Persian Script Award with the main objective of motivating scholars, researchers and the new generation to recognize and study the importance of these scripts. Accordingly, the matter of approving such a proposal was under consideration of the Government.
